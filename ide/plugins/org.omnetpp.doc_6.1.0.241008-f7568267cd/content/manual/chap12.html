<p><h2><a name="sec:ana-sim:result-recording"/>12.1 Result Recording<a class="headerlink" href="#sec:ana-sim:result-recording" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>

<p>OMNeT++ offers built-in support for recording simulation results through
<i>output vectors</i> and <i>output scalars</i>. Output vectors are
time series data recorded from simple modules or channels. They can be used
to record end-to-end delays, round-trip times of packets, queue lengths,
queueing times, module state, link utilization, packet drops, etc. - anything
that provides a comprehensive understanding of the model's behavior during
the simulation.

<p>Output scalars are summary results computed during the simulation and
written out upon completion. A scalar result may be a (integer or real)
number or a statistical summary comprised of several fields, such as count,
mean, standard deviation, sum, minimum, maximum, etc., and optionally,
histogram data.

<p>Results can be collected and recorded in two ways:

<p><ol>
  <li> Based on the signal mechanism, using declared statistics;
  <li> Directly from C++ code, using the simulation library
</ol>

<p>The second method has traditionally been used for result recording. The
first method, based on signals and declared statistics, was introduced in
OMNeT++ 4.1 and is preferable because it allows you to always record the
results in the desired form without requiring extensive instrumentation or
constant adjustments to the simulation model.

<p><h3><a name="sec:ana-sim:signals-and-statistics"/>12.1.1 Using Signals and Declared Statistics<a class="headerlink" href="#sec:ana-sim:signals-and-statistics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

<p>This approach combines the signal mechanism (see
<a href="chap4.html#sec:simple-modules:signals">[4.14]</a>) and NED properties (see
<a href="chap3.html#sec:ned-lang:properties">[3.12]</a>) to decouple the generation and recording of
results, providing greater flexibility in deciding what to record and in
which form. The details of the solution are described in section
<a href="chap4.html#sec:simple-modules:signal-based-statistics">[4.15]</a> in detail; here we provide
a brief overview.

<p>Statistics are declared in the NED files using the <tt>@statistic</tt> property,
and modules emit values using the signal mechanism. The simulation framework
records data by adding special result file writer listeners to the signals.
By choosing which listeners to add, the user can control what gets recorded
in the result files and what computations to apply before recording. The aforementioned
section <a href="chap4.html#sec:simple-modules:signal-based-statistics">[4.15]</a> also explains how to instrument
simple modules and channels for signals-based result recording.

<p>The signals approach allows for the calculation of aggregate statistics (such as the
total number of packet drops in the network) and for implementing a warm-up
period without requiring support from module code. It also allows you to write
dedicated statistics collection modules for the simulation without modifying
existing modules.

<p>The same configuration options used to control result recording
with <tt>cOutVector</tt> and <tt>recordScalar()</tt> also apply when using
the signals approach, and extra configuration options are available to
provide additional functionality.

<p><h3><a name="sec:ana-sim:direct-result-recording"/>12.1.2 Direct Result Recording<a class="headerlink" href="#sec:ana-sim:direct-result-recording" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

<p>With this approach, scalar and statistical results are collected as class
variables within modules and then recorded during the finalization phase
using <tt>recordScalar()</tt> calls. Vectors are recorded using
<tt>cOutVector</tt> objects. Use <tt>cStdDev</tt> to record summary statistics
such as mean, standard deviation, minimum/maximum, and histogram-like classes
(<tt>cHistogram</tt>, <tt>cPSquare</tt>, <tt>cKSplit</tt>) to
record the distribution. These classes are described in sections
<a href="chap7.html#sec:sim-lib:statistics">[7.9]</a> and <a href="chap7.html#sec:sim-lib:result-recording">[7.10]</a>.
Recording of individual vectors, scalars, and statistics can be enabled or
disabled via the configuration (ini) file, where recording intervals for
vectors can also be set.

<p>The drawback of recording results directly from modules is that result
recording is hardcoded in the modules, and even simple requirement changes
(e.g., recording the average delay instead of each delay value, or vice versa)
require either code modification or an excessive amount of result collection
code within the modules.

<p>

<p><h2><a name="sec:ana-sim:config-results"/>12.2 Configuring Result Collection<a class="headerlink" href="#sec:ana-sim:config-results" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>

<p><h3><a name="sec:ana-sim:result-file-names"/>12.2.1 Result File Names<a class="headerlink" href="#sec:ana-sim:result-file-names" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

<p>Simulation results are recorded into <i>output scalar files</i> that also hold
statistics results, and <i>output vector files</i>. The usual file extension
for scalar files is <tt>.sca</tt>, and for vector files <tt>.vec</tt>.

<p>Every simulation run generates a single scalar file and a vector file. The file
names can be controlled with the <b><tt>output-vector-file</tt></b> and
<b><tt>output-scalar-file</tt></b> options. These options rarely need to be used
because the default values are usually sufficient. The defaults are:

<pre class="inifile">
output-vector-file = "${resultdir}/${configname}-${runnumber}.vec"
output-scalar-file = "${resultdir}/${configname}-${runnumber}.sca"
</pre>
<p>
Here, <tt>${resultdir}</tt> is the value of the <b><tt>result-dir</tt></b>
configuration option which defaults to <tt>results/</tt>, and
<tt>${configname}</tt> and <tt>${runnumber}</tt> are the names of the
configuration name in the ini file (e.g., <tt>[Config PureAloha]</tt>), and the run
number, respectively. Thus, the above defaults generate file names such as
<tt>results/PureAloha-0.vec</tt>, <tt>results/PureAloha-1.vec</tt>, and so on.



<p><h3><a name="sec:ana-sim:disabling-result-items"/>12.2.2 Enabling/Disabling Result Items<a class="headerlink" href="#sec:ana-sim:disabling-result-items" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

<p>The recording of simulation results can be enabled or disabled at multiple
levels with various configuration options:

<p><ul>
  <li> All recording from a <b><tt>@statistic</tt></b> can be enabled or disabled
    together using the <b><tt>statistic-recording</tt></b> option.
  <li> Recording of a scalar or a statistic object can be controlled with the
    <b><tt>scalar-recording</tt></b> option.
  <li> Recording of an output vector can be controlled with the
    <b><tt>vector-recording</tt></b> option.
  <li> Recording of the bins of a histogram object can be controlled with the
    <b><tt>bin-recording</tt></b> option.
</ul>

<p>All the above options are boolean per-object options; thus, they have similar syntaxes:

<p><ul>
  <li> <i>&lt;module-path&gt;.&lt;statistic-name&gt;.</i><b><tt>statistic-recording</tt></b><tt> = true/false</tt>
  <li> <i>&lt;module-path&gt;.&lt;scalar-name&gt;.</i><b><tt>scalar-recording</tt></b><tt> = true/false</tt>
  <li> <i>&lt;module-path&gt;.&lt;vector-name&gt;.</i><b><tt>vector-recording</tt></b><tt> = true/false</tt>
  <li> <i>&lt;module-path&gt;.&lt;histogram-name&gt;.</i><b><tt>bin-recording</tt></b><tt> = true/false</tt>
</ul>

<p>For example, recording from the following statistic:

<pre class="ned">
@statistic[queueLength](record=max,timeavg,vector);
</pre>
<p>
can be disabled with this ini file line:

<pre class="inifile">
**.queueLength.statistic-recording = false
</pre>
<p>
When a scalar, vector, or histogram is recorded using a <b><tt>@statistic</tt></b>, its
name is derived from the statistic name by appending the recording mode after a
semicolon. For example, the above statistic will generate the scalars named
<tt>queueLength:max</tt> and <tt>queueLength:timeavg</tt>, and the vector named
<tt>queueLength:vector</tt>. Their recording can be individually disabled with the
following lines:

<pre class="inifile">
**.queueLength:max.scalar-recording = false
**.queueLength:timeavg.scalar-recording = false
**.queueLength:vector.vector-recording = false
</pre>
<p>
The statistic, scalar, or vector name part in the key may also contain
wildcards. This can be used, for example, to handle result items with similar
names together or, by using <tt>*</tt> as the name, for filtering by module or to
disable all recording. The following example turns off recording of all scalar
results except those called <tt>latency</tt> and those produced by modules named
<tt>tcp</tt>:

<pre class="inifile">
**.tcp.*.scalar-recording = true
**.latency.scalar-recording = true
**.scalar-recording = false
</pre>
<p>
To disable all result recording, use the following three lines:

<pre class="inifile">
**.statistic-recording = false
**.scalar-recording = false
**.vector-recording = false
</pre>
<p>
The first line is not strictly necessary. However, it may improve runtime
performance because it causes result recorders not to be added instead of adding
and then disabling them.

<p><h3><a name="sec:ana-sim:configuring-recording-modes"/>12.2.3 Selecting Recording Modes for Signal-Based Statistics<a class="headerlink" href="#sec:ana-sim:configuring-recording-modes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

<p>Signal-based statistics recording has been designed so that it can be easily
configured to record a &#8220;default minimal&#8221; set of results, a &#8220;detailed&#8221; set of
results, and a custom set of results (by modifying the previous ones or defining
from scratch).

<p>Recording can be tuned with the <b><tt>result-recording-modes</tt></b> per-object
configuration option. The &#8220;object&#8221; here is the statistic, which is identified by
the full path (hierarchical name) of the module or connection channel object in
question, plus the name of the statistic (which is the &#8220;index&#8221; of
<b><tt>@statistic</tt></b> property, i.e., the name in the square brackets). Thus,
configuration keys have the syntax
<i>&lt;module-path&gt;.&lt;statistic-name&gt;.</i><tt>result-recording-modes=</tt>.

<p>The <b><tt>result-recording-modes</tt></b> option accepts one or more items as a
value, separated by a comma. An item may be a result recording mode and two
words with a special meaning: <tt>default</tt> and <tt>all</tt>.

<p><ul>
  <li> A <i>result recording mode</i> refers to any item that may occur in the
    <tt>record</tt> key of the <b><tt>@statistic</tt></b> property; for example, <tt>count</tt>,
    <tt>sum</tt>, <tt>mean</tt>, <tt>vector((count-1)/2)</tt>.
  <li> <tt>default</tt> stands for the set of non-optional items from the
    <b><tt>@statistic</tt></b> property's <tt>record</tt> list, i.e., those without question
    marks.
  <li> <tt>all</tt> means all items from the <b><tt>@statistic</tt></b> property's
    <tt>record</tt> list, including the ones with question marks.
</ul>

<p>The default value is <tt>default</tt>.

<p>A lone &#8220;-&#8221; as the option value disables all recording modes.

<p><i>Recording mode</i> items in the list may be prefixed with &#8220;+&#8221; or
&#8220;-&#8221; to add/remove them from the set of result recording modes. The
initial set of result recording modes is <tt>default</tt>; if the first item
is prefixed with &#8220;+&#8221; or &#8220;-&#8221;, then that and all subsequent items are
understood as modifying the set; if the first item does not start with
&#8220;+&#8221; or &#8220;-&#8221;, then it replaces the set, and further items are understood
as modifying the set.

<p>This may sound more complicated than it is, and an example will make it clear.
Suppose we are configuring the following statistic:

<pre class="ned">
@statistic[foo](record=count,mean,max?,vector?);
</pre>
<p>
With the following ini file lines (see results in comments):

<pre class="inifile">
**.result-recording-modes = default  # --&gt; count, mean
**.result-recording-modes = all      # --&gt; count, mean, max, vector
**.result-recording-modes = -        # --&gt; none
**.result-recording-modes = mean     # --&gt; only mean (disables 'default')
**.result-recording-modes = default,-vector,+histogram # --&gt; count,mean,histogram
**.result-recording-modes = -vector,+histogram         # --&gt; same as the previous
**.result-recording-modes = all,-vector,+histogram  # --&gt; count,mean,max,histogram
</pre>
<p>
Here is another example that shows how to write a more specific option key. The
following line applies to <tt>queueLength</tt> statistics of <tt>fifo[]</tt> submodule
vectors anywhere in the network:

<pre class="inifile">
**.fifo[*].queueLength.result-recording-modes = +vector  # default plus vector
</pre>
<p>
In the result file, the recorded scalars will be suffixed with the recording
mode; for example, the mean of <tt>queueingTime</tt> will be recorded as
<tt>queueingTime:mean</tt>.

<p><h3><a name="sec:ana-sim:warmup-period"/>12.2.4 Warm-up Period<a class="headerlink" href="#sec:ana-sim:warmup-period" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

<p>The <b><tt>warmup-period</tt></b> option specifies the length of the initial warm-up
period. When set, results belonging to the first <i>x</i> seconds of the simulation
will not be recorded into output vectors and will not be counted in the
calculation of output scalars. This option is useful for steady-state
simulations. The default is 0s (no warm-up period).

<p>Example:

<pre class="inifile">
warmup-period = 20s
</pre>
<p>

<p><h4><a name="sec:ana-sim:refining-warmup-period-handling"/>12.2.4.1 Refining Warm-up Period Handling<a class="headerlink" href="#sec:ana-sim:refining-warmup-period-handling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>

<p>Warm-up period handling works by inserting a special filter, a <i>warm-up
period filter</i>, into the filter/recorder chain if a warm-up period is requested.
This filter acts like a timed switch: it discards values during the specified
warm-up period and allows them to pass through afterwards.

<p>OMNeT++ allows you to disable the automatic adding of warm-up filters by
specifying <tt>autoWarmupFilter=false</tt> in the <tt>@statistic</tt> as an attribute
and manually placing such filters (<tt>warmup</tt>) instead.

<p>Why is this necessary? By default, the filter is inserted at the front of the
filter/recorder chain of every statistic. However, the front is not always the
correct place for the warm-up period filter. Consider, for example, computing
the number of packets in a (compound) queue as the difference between the number
of arrivals and departures from the queue. This can be achieved using
<tt>@statistic</tt> as follows:

<pre class="ned">
@signal[pkIn](type=cPacket);
@signal[pkOut](type=cPacket);
@statistic[queueLen](source=count(pkIn)-count(pkOut);record=vector);
</pre>
<p>
When a warm-up period is configured, the necessary warm-up period filters are
inserted right before the <i>count</i> filters. This can be expressed as the
following expression for the statistic's <tt>source</tt> attribute:

<pre class="ned">
count(warmup(pkIn)) - count(warmup(pkOut))
</pre>
<p>
which is apparently incorrect because the <i>count</i> filters only start
counting when the warm-up period is over. Thus, the measured queue length will
start from zero when the warm-up period is over, even though the queue might not
be empty! In fact, if the first event after the warm-up period is a departure,
the measured queue length will even go negative.

<p>The correct solution would be to put the <tt>warmup</tt> filter at the end like so:

<pre class="ned">
warmup(count(pkIn)-count(pkOut))
</pre>
<p>
Thus, the correct form of the queue length statistic is the following:

<pre class="ned">
@statistic[queueLen](source=warmup(count(pkIn)-count(pkOut));
                     autoWarmupFilter=false;
                     record=vector);
</pre>
<p>

<p><h4><a name="sec:ana-sim:warmup-period-manual-result-recording"/>12.2.4.2 Manual Result Recording<a class="headerlink" href="#sec:ana-sim:warmup-period-manual-result-recording" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>

<p>Results recorded via signal-based statistics automatically obey the warm-up
period setting, but modules that compute and record scalar results manually (via
<tt>recordScalar()</tt>) need to be modified so that they take the warm-up period
into account.

<p><ul class="note"><b>NOTE</b><br>
When configuring a warm-up period, make sure that modules that compute and
record scalar results manually via <tt>recordScalar()</tt> actually obey the
warm-up period in the C++ code.
</ul>

<p>The warm-up period is available via the <tt>getWarmupPeriod()</tt> method of the
simulation manager object, so the C++ code that updates the corresponding state
variables needs to be surrounded with an <i>if</i> statement.

<p>Old:

<pre class="cpp">
dropCount++;
</pre>
<p>
New:

<pre class="cpp">

    dropCount++;
</pre>
<p>

<p><h3><a name="sec:ana-sim:vector-recording-intervals"/>12.2.5 Output Vectors Recording Intervals<a class="headerlink" href="#sec:ana-sim:vector-recording-intervals" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

<p>The size of output vector files can easily reach several gigabytes, but very
often, only some of the recorded statistics are interesting to the analyst. In
addition to selecting which vectors to record, OMNeT++ also allows one to specify
one or more collection intervals.

<p>The latter can be configured with the <b><tt>vector-recording-intervals</tt></b>
per-object option. The syntax of the configuration option is
<i>&lt;module-path&gt;.&lt;vector-name&gt;.</i><tt>vector-recording-intervals=</tt><i>&lt;intervals&gt;</i>,
where both <i>&lt;module-path&gt;</i> and <i>&lt;vector-name&gt;</i> may contain
wildcards (see <a href="chap10.html#sec:config-sim:wildcards">[10.3.1]</a>). <i>&lt;vector-name&gt;</i> is the
vector name or the name string of the <tt>cOutVector</tt> object. By default, all
output vectors are enabled for the whole duration of the simulation.

<p>One can specify one or more intervals in the <i>&lt;startTime&gt;..&lt;stopTime&gt;</i>
syntax, separated by a comma. <i>&lt;startTime&gt;</i> or <i>&lt;stopTime&gt;</i> need
to be given with measurement units, and both can be omitted to denote the
beginning and the end of the simulation, respectively.

<p>The following example limits all vectors to three intervals, except
<tt>dropCount</tt> vectors which will be recorded during the whole simulation run:

<pre class="inifile">
**.dropCount.vector-recording-intervals = 0..
**.vector-recording-intervals = 0..1000s, 5000s..6000s, 9000s..
</pre>
<p>
<h3><a name="sec:ana-sim:vector-eventnum-recording"/>12.2.6 Recording Event Numbers in Output Vectors<a class="headerlink" href="#sec:ana-sim:vector-eventnum-recording" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

<p>A third per-vector configuration option is <b><tt>vector-record-eventnumbers</tt></b>,
which specifies whether to record event numbers for an output vector (simulation
time and value are always recorded).<br><ul><font size=-1>[Event numbers are needed
by the Sequence Chart Tool, for example.]</font></ul> Event number recording is enabled by
default and may be turned off to save disk space.

<pre class="inifile">
**.vector-record-eventnumbers = false
</pre>
<p>
If the (default) <tt>cIndexedFileOutputVectorManager</tt> class is used to
record output vectors, there are two more options to fine-tune its resource
usage. <tt>output-vectors-memory-limit</tt> specifies the total memory that can be
used for buffering output vectors. Larger values produce less-fragmented vector
files (i.e., cause vector data to be grouped into larger chunks) and therefore
allow more efficient processing later. <tt>vector-max-buffered-values</tt>
specifies the maximum number of values to buffer per vector before writing out a
block into the output vector file. The default is no per-vector limit (i.e.,
only the total memory limit is in effect).

<p><h3><a name="sec:ana-sim:saving-parameters-as-scalars"/>12.2.7 Saving Parameters as Scalars<a class="headerlink" href="#sec:ana-sim:saving-parameters-as-scalars" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

<p>When running several simulations with different parameter settings, it is often
useful to refer to selected input parameters in the result analysis as well. For
example, when drawing a throughput (or response time) versus load (or network
background traffic) plot, average throughput or response time numbers are saved
into the output scalar files. Therefore, it is also useful for the input
parameters to be saved into the same file.

<p>For convenience, OMNeT++ automatically saves the iteration variables into the
output scalar file if they have a numeric value so that they can be referred to
during result analysis.

<p><ul class="warning"><b>WARNING</b><br>
    If an iteration variable has a non-numeric value, it will not be recorded
    automatically and cannot be used during analysis. This can unintentionally
    happen if you specify units inside an iteration variable list:

<pre class="inifile">
**.param = exponential( ${mean=0.2s, 0.4s, 0.6s} )  #WRONG!
**.param = exponential( ${mean=0.2, 0.4, 0.6}s )    #OK
</pre>
<p></ul>

<p>Module parameters can also be saved, but this has to be requested by the user by
configuring <tt>param-record-as-scalar=true</tt> for the parameters in question.
The configuration key is a pattern that identifies the parameter plus
<tt>.param-record-as-scalar</tt>. An example:

<pre class="inifile">
**.host[*].networkLoad.param-record-as-scalar = true
</pre>
<p>
This looks simple enough, but there are three pitfalls: non-numeric parameters,
too many matching parameters, and randomly valued volatile parameters.

<p>First, the scalar file only holds numeric results, so non-numeric parameters
cannot be recorded; otherwise, a runtime error will occur.

<p>Second, if wildcards in the pattern match too many parameters, the size of the
scalar file might unnecessarily increase. For example, if the <tt>host[]</tt>
module vector size is 1000 in the example below, then the same value (3) will be
saved 1000 times into the scalar file, once for each host.

<pre class="inifile">
**.host[*].startTime = 3
**.host[*].startTime.param-record-as-scalar = true  # saves "3" once for each host
</pre>
<p>
Third, recording a random-valued volatile parameter will save a random number
from that distribution. This is rarely what you need, and the simulation kernel
will also issue a warning if this happens.

<pre class="inifile">
**.interarrivalTime = exponential(1s)
**.interarrivalTime.param-record-as-scalar = true  # wrong: saves random values!
</pre>
<p>
These pitfalls are quite common in practice, so it is usually better to rely on
the iteration variables in the result analysis. That is, one can rewrite the
above example as:

<pre class="inifile">
**.interarrivalTime = exponential( ${mean=1}s )
</pre>
<p>
and refer to the <tt>$mean</tt> iteration variable instead of the interarrivalTime
module parameter(s) during result analysis. <tt>param-record-as-scalar=true</tt> is
not needed because iteration variables are automatically saved into the result
files.

<p><h3><a name="sec:ana-sim:outputfile-precision"/>12.2.8 Recording Precision<a class="headerlink" href="#sec:ana-sim:outputfile-precision" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

<p>Output scalar and output vector files are text files, and floating-point values
(<tt>double</tt>s) are recorded into them using the <tt>fprintf()</tt> function with
the <tt>"%g"</tt> format. The number of significant digits can be configured using
the <b><tt>output-scalar-precision</tt></b> and <b><tt>output-vector-precision</tt></b>
configuration options.

<p>The default precision is 12 digits. When setting a different value, the
following considerations apply:

<p>IEEE-754 doubles are 64-bit numbers. The mantissa is 52 bits, which is roughly
equivalent to 16 decimal places (52*log(2)/log(10)). However, due to rounding
errors, usually only 12 to 14 digits are correct, and the rest are essentially
random garbage that should be ignored. Furthermore, when converting the decimal
representation back into a <tt>double</tt> for result processing, an additional
small error will occur because 0.1, 0.01, etc., cannot be accurately represented
in binary. This conversion error is usually smaller than what the <tt>double</tt>
variable already had before recording it into the file. However, if it is
important, the recording precision can be set to 16 digits or more to eliminate
this error (but again, be aware that the last digits are garbage). The practical
upper limit is 17 digits; setting it higher does not make any difference in the
output of <tt>fprintf()</tt>.


Errors resulting from rounding and conversion can be eliminated by choosing an
output vector/output scalar manager class that stores <tt>double</tt>s in their
native binary form. The appropriate configuration options are
<b><tt>outputvectormanager-class</tt></b> and <b><tt>outputvectormanager-class</tt></b>. For
example, <tt>cMySQLOutputScalarManager</tt> and
<tt>cMySQLOutputScalarManager</tt> provided in <tt>samples/database</tt> fulfill
this requirement.

<p>However, before worrying too much about rounding and conversion errors, consider
the real accuracy of your results:

<p><ul>
  <li> In real life, it is very difficult to measure quantities (weight,
    distance, even time) with more than a few digits of precision. What is the
    precision of your input data? For example, if you approximate inter-arrival
    time as <i>exponential(0.153)</i> when the mean is really
    <i>0.152601...</i> and the distribution is not even exactly exponential, you
    are already starting out with a bigger error than rounding can cause.
  <li> The simulation model itself is an approximation of real life. How much
    error do the (known and unknown) simplifications cause in the results?
</ul>

<p><h3><a name="sec:ana-sim:omnetpp-result-file-format"/>12.3.1 The OMNeT++ Result File Format<a class="headerlink" href="#sec:ana-sim:omnetpp-result-file-format" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

<p>By default, OMNeT++ saves simulation results into textual, line-oriented files.
The advantage of a text-based, line-oriented format is that it is highly
accessible and easy to parse with a wide range of tools and languages, while
still providing enough flexibility to represent the necessary data (in contrast
to formats like CSV). This section provides an overview of these file formats
(output vector and output scalar files); the precise specification is available
in the Appendix (<a href="chap28.html#cha:result-file-formats">[28]</a>).


By default, each file contains data from only one run.

<p>Result files start with a header that contains several attributes of the
simulation run: a reasonably globally unique run ID, the network NED type
name, the experiment-measurement-replication labels, the values of
iteration variables and the repetition counter, the date and time, the host
name, the process id of the simulation, random number seeds, configuration
options, and so on. This data can be useful during result processing and
increase the reproducibility of the results.

<p>
Vectors are recorded into a separate file for practical reasons: vector
data usually consume several magnitudes more disk space than scalars.

<p>
<h4><a name="sec:ana-sim:output-vector-files"/>12.3.1.1 Output Vector Files<a class="headerlink" href="#sec:ana-sim:output-vector-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>

<p>All output vectors from a simulation run are recorded into the same file.
The following sections describe the format of the file and
how to process it.

<p>An example file fragment (without header):

<pre class="filelisting">
...
vector 1   net.host[12]  responseTime  TV
1  12.895  2355.66
1  14.126  4577.66664666
vector 2   net.router[9].ppp[0] queueLength  TV
2  16.960  2
1  23.086  2355.66666666
2  24.026  8
...
</pre>
<p>
There are two types of lines: vector declaration lines (beginning with the word
<tt>vector</tt>) and data lines. A <i>vector declaration line</i>
introduces a new output vector, and its columns are: vector Id, module of
creation, name of <tt>cOutVector</tt> object, and multiplicity (usually 1).
Actual data recorded in this vector are on <i>data lines</i> which begin
with the vector Id. Further columns on data lines are the simulation time
and the recorded value.

<p>
Since OMNeT++ 4.0, vector data has been recorded into the file clustered by
output vectors, which, combined with index files, allows much more
efficient processing. Using the index file, tools can extract particular
vectors by reading only those parts of the file where the desired data are
located, and they do not need to scan through the whole file linearly.

<p>
<h4><a name="sec:ana-sim:scalar-result-files"/>12.3.1.2 Scalar Result Files<a class="headerlink" href="#sec:ana-sim:scalar-result-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>

<p>Fragment of an output scalar file (without header):

scalar "lan.hostA.mac" "bytes sent"   64869
scalar "lan.hostA.mac" "bytes rcvd"   3529448
...
</pre>
<p>
Every scalar generates one <tt>scalar</tt> line in the file.

<p>Statistics objects (<tt>cStatistic</tt> subclasses such as <tt>cStdDev</tt>)
generate several lines: mean, standard deviation, etc.

<p><h3><a name="sec:ana-sim:sqlite-result-files"/>12.3.2 SQLite Result Files<a class="headerlink" href="#sec:ana-sim:sqlite-result-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

<p>Starting from version 5.1, OMNeT++ contains experimental support for
saving simulation results into SQLite database files. The perceived advantage
of SQLite is its existing support in many existing tools and languages (no need to
write custom parsers), and being able to use the power of the SQL language
for queries. The latter is very useful for processing scalar results, and less
so for vectors and histograms.

<p>To enable a simulation to record its results in SQLite format, add the following
configuration options to its <tt>omnetpp.ini</tt>:

<pre class="inifile">
outputvectormanager-class="omnetpp::envir::SqliteOutputVectorManager"
outputscalarmanager-class="omnetpp::envir::SqliteOutputScalarManager"
</pre>
<p>
<ul class="note"><b>NOTE</b><br>
Alternatively, to make SQLite the default format, recompile OMNeT++ with
<tt>PREFER_SQLITE_RESULT_FILES=yes</tt> set in <tt>configure.user</tt>.
(Don't forget to also run  <tt>./configure</tt> before <tt>make</tt>.)
</ul>

<p>The SQLite result files will be created with the same names as textual
result files. The two formats also store exactly the same data, only in
a different way (there is a one-to-one correspondence between them). The
Simulation IDE and <tt>scavetool</tt> also understand both formats.

<p><ul class="hint"><b>HINT</b><br>
If you want to get acquainted with the organization of SQLite result
files, exploring one in a graphical tool such as SQLiteBrowser or SQLite
Studio should be a good start.
</ul>

<p>The database schema can be found in Appendix <a href="chap28.html#cha:result-file-formats">[28]</a>.

<p><h3><a name="sec:ana-sim:scavetool"/>12.3.3 Scavetool<a class="headerlink" href="#sec:ana-sim:scavetool" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<!--scavetool-->

<p>OMNeT++'s <tt>opp_scavetool</tt> program is a command-line tool for exploring,
filtering, and processing result files, and exporting the result in formats
that are compatible with other tools.

<p><h4><a name="sec:ana-sim:scavetool:commands"/>12.3.3.1 Commands<a class="headerlink" href="#sec:ana-sim:scavetool:commands" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>

<p><tt>opp_scavetool</tt> functionality is grouped under four commands:
<tt>query</tt>, <tt>export</tt>, <tt>index</tt>, and <tt>help</tt>.

<p><ul>

<p><li> <b>query</b>: Query the contents of result files. One can list
    runs, run attributes, result items, unique result names, unique module
    names, unique configuration names, etc. One can filter for result types
    (scalar/vector/histogram) and by run, module name, result name, and value,
    using match expressions. There are various options controlling the format
    of the output (group-by-runs; grep-friendly; suppress labels; several
    modes for identifying the run in the output, etc.)

<p><li> <b>export</b>: Export results in various formats. Results can be filtered
    by run, module name, result name, and more, using match expressions. Output
    vectors can be cropped to a time interval. Several output formats are
    available: CSV in two flavors (one for machine consumption, and a more
    informal one for human consumption via loading into spreadsheet programs),
    OMNeT++ output scalar/vector file (default), OMNeT++ SQLite result file, and
    JSON (again two flavors: one strictly adhering to the JSON rules, and
    another with slightly more relaxed rules but also more expressive). All
    exporters have multiple options for fine-tuning the output.

<p><li> <b>index</b>: Generate index files (.vci) for vector files. Note that this
    command is usually not needed, as other scavetool commands automatically create
    vector file indices if they are missing or out of date (unless indexing is
    explicitly disabled). This command can also be used to rebuild a vector file
    so that data are clustered by vectors for more efficient access.

<p><li> <b>help</b>: Prints help. The synopsys is <tt>opp_scavetool help &lt;topic&gt;</tt>,
    where any command name can be used as a topic, plus there are
    additional ones like <tt>patterns</tt> or <tt>filters</tt>. <tt>scavetool
    &lt;command&gt; -h</tt> also works.

<p></ul>

<p>The default command is <tt>query</tt>, so its name can be omitted on the
command line.

<h2><a name="sec:ana-sim:python"/>12.4 Result Analysis<a class="headerlink" href="#sec:ana-sim:python" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>

<p>The recommended method for analyzing simulation results is using the
<i>Analysis Tool</i> in the <i>Simulation IDE</i>. The Analysis Tool
provides a user-friendly interface for selecting result files, browsing their
contents, selecting desired results, and creating plots. The resulting plots and
data can be exported in several formats, both individually and in batches. There
are various chart types to choose from, and it is also possible to create custom
charts.

<p>Charts in the Analysis Tool utilize Python scripts. The Python scripts behind
the charts are open for the user to view and edit, enabling the implementation
of arbitrary logic and computations. Visualization can be done using the IDE's
native plotting widgets or with Matplotlib. Using Matplotlib offers virtually
limitless possibilities for visualization.<br><ul><font size=-1>[It is worth noting that
Matplotlib has extensions like Seaborn, Canopy, HoloViews, etc., which can also
be used in chart scripts, further expanding the set of possibilities.]</font></ul> The IDE's
own plotting widgets have more limited functionality, but they are much more
scalable compared to Matplotlib.

<p><ul class="note"><b>NOTE</b><br>
It is important to note the distinction in terminology. While the terms
<i>chart</i> and <i>plot</i> are often used interchangeably in everyday
speech, they carry related but distinct meanings in the context of OMNeT++ result
analysis. When we refer to a <i>chart</i>, we essentially mean a Python script
with associated metadata and parameterization that serves as a &#8220;recipe&#8221; for
producing a <i>plot</i>. The term <i>plot</i> is used to refer to the
graphics that appear as the result of running the chart script.
</ul>

<p>Chart scripts can also be used outside the IDE. The scripts saved as part of the
IDE's analysis files (<tt>.anf</tt>) can be viewed or run using the
<tt>opp_chartool</tt> command-line program. Additionally, the result processing
capabilities can be utilized in standalone Python scripts. When chart scripts
are run outside the IDE, the native plotting widgets are &#8220;emulated&#8221; using
Matplotlib.

<p>The Analysis Tool is thoroughly covered in the User Guide. The following
sections focus on the programming API.

<p><h3><a name="sec:ana-sim:python_packages"/>12.4.1 Python Packages<a class="headerlink" href="#sec:ana-sim:python_packages" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

<p>Chart scripts heavily rely on the following widely-used Python packages:

<p><ul>
  <li> <i>NumPy</i>: Utilized for efficient representation of numeric arrays
    and related operations.
  <li> <i>Pandas</i>: Used for representing and manipulating simulation
    results through <tt>DataFrame</tt>s.
  <li> <i>Matplotlib</i>: Used for generating the actual plots.
</ul>

<p>The following packages are added by OMNeT++:

<p><ul>
  <li> <i>omnetpp.scave.results</i>: Provides access to the simulation
    results for the chart script. The results are returned as Pandas
    <tt>DataFrame</tt>s in various formats.
  <li> <i>omnetpp.scave.chart</i>: Provides access to the properties of the
    current chart for the chart script.
  <li> <i>omnetpp.scave.ideplot</i>: This module is the interface for
    displaying plots with the IDE's native plotting widgets. The API closely
    resembles <tt>matplotlib.pyplot</tt>, facilitating the porting of scripts between
    the two APIs. When a chart script runs without the native plotting widget
    environment, such as when executed from <tt>opp_chartool</tt>, the functions
    are emulated using Matplotlib.
  <li> <i>omnetpp.scave.utils</i>: A collection of utility functions for data
    manipulation and plotting, built on top of <tt>DataFrame</tt>s and the
    <tt>chart</tt> and <tt>plot</tt> packages from <tt>omnetpp.scave</tt>.
  <li> <i>omnetpp.scave.vectorops</i>: Contains operations that can be
    applied to output vectors.
</ul>

<p>In addition, there is an extra module:

<p><ul>
  <li> <i>omnetpp.scave.analysis</i>: Provides support for reading and
    writing analysis (anf) files from Python, and running chart scripts in them
    for display, image export, or data export.
</ul>

<p>These packages are thoroughly documented in Appendix <a href="chap30.html#cha:chart-api">[30]</a>.

<p><h3><a name="sec:ana-sim:example_chart_script"/>12.4.2 An Example Chart Script<a class="headerlink" href="#sec:ana-sim:example_chart_script" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

<p>Since information on NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib can be found extensively
online, and a reference for the <tt>omnetpp.scave.*</tt> Python packages is
provided in Appendix <a href="chap30.html#cha:chart-api">[30]</a>, it is unnecessary to explain their functionality in
depth here. Instead, this section will walk through an actual chart script to
demonstrate its practical implementation.

<p>The selected chart script is for the bar chart, which serves as a representative
example. It will help readers understand other chart scripts, modify them to
meet specific requirements, or even create their own. The script is relatively
short and straightforward, making it easy to follow. The source code is provided
below, along with explanations after certain lines.

<p><pre class="cpp">
from omnetpp.scave import results, chart, utils
</pre>

<p>The first lines import the required packages that will be used in the chart
script. This step is necessary as no modules are automatically imported when the
chart script starts.

<p>It is worth noting that all imported modules are under the <tt>omnetpp.scave</tt>
module, rather than being imported directly from the <tt>numpy</tt>, <tt>pandas</tt>,
or <tt>matplotlib</tt> packages. This distinction exists because almost all
necessary functionality is already contained within convenience methods in the
<tt>utils</tt> and <tt>plot</tt> modules.

<p><pre class="cpp">
# get chart properties
props = chart.get_properties()
</pre>

<p>In this part, the properties of the bar chart are obtained using the <tt>chart</tt>
module. The <tt>props</tt> object is a Python <tt>dict</tt> that contains entries
influenced by the chart properties dialog, acting as parameters for the chart
script and the resulting plot.

<p>Adding <tt>print(props)</tt> or <tt>for k,v in props.items(): print(repr(k), "=",
repr(v))</tt> to the code will output the following after the chart script runs:

<pre class="commandline">
'confidence_level' = '95\%'
'filter' = 'type =~ scalar AND name =~ channelUtilization:last'
'grid_show' = 'true'
'legend_prefer_result_titles' = 'true'
'title' = ''
'legend_show' = 'true'
'matplotlibrc' = ''
...
</pre>
<p>
Many of the entries should look familiar, as most of them correspond directly to
widgets in the <i>Chart <a href="../api/classomnetpp_1_1nedxml_1_1MsgTypeTable_1_1Properties.html">Properties</a></i> dialog in the IDE. It is important to
note that all values are strings.

<p><pre class="cpp">
utils.preconfigure_plot(props)
</pre>

<p>The <tt>preconfigure_plot()</tt> call is a mandatory part of a chart script. Its
purpose is to ensure that visual properties take effect in the plot. It is worth
mentioning that there will also be a <tt>postconfigure_plot()</tt> call since
some properties need to be set before plotting, while others require
configuration after the plotting stage.

<p><pre class="cpp">
# collect parameters for query
filter_expression = props["filter"]
include_fields = props["include_fields"] == "true"
</pre>

<p>In this part, the result query string is obtained from the properties. This
query string selects the subset of results that will be used as input for the
chart from the complete set of results loaded from the result files. The
<tt>"filter"</tt> property is applicable to almost all chart types.

<p>Since bar charts work with scalars, users are given the option to choose whether
fields (such as <tt>:mean</tt>, <tt>:count</tt>, <tt>:sum</tt>, etc.) of vector,
statistics, and histogram results should be included in the source dataset as
scalars.

<p><pre class="cpp">
# query scalar data into dataframe
try:
    df = results.get_scalars(filter_expression, include_fields=include_fields,
             include_attrs=True, include_runattrs=True, include_itervars=True)
except ValueError as e:
    raise chart.ChartScriptError("Error while querying results: " + str(e))
</pre>

<p>In this section, the <tt>results.get_scalars()</tt> function is used to acquire
the data for the plot. It is the most significant part of the script. The
function utilizes the <tt>results</tt> module to obtain the data. The resulting
Pandas <tt>DataFrame</tt> contains one row for each scalar result. Columns include
<tt>runID</tt>, which uniquely identifies the simulation run, <tt>module</tt>,
<tt>name</tt>, and <tt>value</tt> referring to the scalar. It also includes various
other columns representing metadata such as result attributes, iteration
variables, and run attributes (<tt>iaMean</tt>, <tt>numHosts</tt>, <tt>configname</tt>,
<tt>datetime</tt>, etc.).

<p>By adding <tt>print(df)</tt> to the code, the contents of the dataframe can be
printed. The output will resemble the following (for brevity, some less
important columns are omitted and the name of the last column, <tt>repetition</tt>,
is abbreviated):

<pre class="commandline">
          module                     name     value iaMean numHosts rep.
0   Aloha.server  channelUtilization:last  0.156057      1       10    0
1   Aloha.server  channelUtilization:last  0.156176      1       10    1
2   Aloha.server  channelUtilization:last  0.196381      2       10    0
3   Aloha.server  channelUtilization:last  0.193253      2       10    1
4   Aloha.server  channelUtilization:last  0.176507      3       10    0
5   Aloha.server  channelUtilization:last  0.176136      3       10    1
6   Aloha.server  channelUtilization:last  0.152471      4       10    0
7   Aloha.server  channelUtilization:last  0.154667      4       10    1
11  Aloha.server  channelUtilization:last  0.108992      7       10    0
...
</pre>
<p>
It's worth noting that <tt>try...except</tt> is used here to catch any exceptions
(typically syntax errors in the query) and report them to the user in a more
user-friendly manner instead of displaying a stack trace. Raising a
<tt>chart.ChartScriptError</tt> displays the provided message in the plot area.

<p><pre class="cpp">
if df.empty:
    raise chart.ChartScriptError("The result filter returned no data.")
</pre>

<p>If the query doesn't match any results, this line will raise an exception
to inform the user instead of letting them discover it from the empty plot.

<p><pre class="cpp">
groups, series = utils.select_groups_series(df, props)
</pre>

<p>The <i>Groups</i> and <i>Series</i> fields in the <i>Chart <a href="../api/classomnetpp_1_1nedxml_1_1MsgTypeTable_1_1Properties.html">Properties</a></i>
dialog define how the bar chart will be organized. If these fields are populated
with multiple variables (comma-separated), this step will split the values and
convert them into lists.

<p>If these fields are left empty, the script will attempt to find reasonable
values for them. It will also detect various misconfigurations (such as
non-existent column names or overlap between "groups" and "series" columns) and
inform the user of any issues. Omitting these checks would likely lead to
spurious Pandas exceptions later on, which often provide insufficient guidance
to the user about the actual problem.

<p><pre class="cpp">
confidence_level = utils.get_confidence_level(props)
</pre>

<p>In this section, the requested confidence level is extracted from the
properties. The user can select <tt>"none"</tt> from the combo box in the dialog to
disable confidence interval computation.

<p><pre class="cpp">
valuedf, errorsdf, metadf =
    utils.pivot_for_barchart(df, groups, series, confidence_level)
utils.plot_bars(valuedf, errorsdf, metadf, props)
</pre>

<p>Finally, the important part of the script is reached, which involves pivoting
the data and plotting it. The function <tt>utils.pivot_for_barchart()</tt> is
used for pivoting, and <tt>utils.plot_bars()</tt> is used for plotting.

<p>If a <tt>print(valuedf)</tt> statement is added, the result of pivoting will be displayed:

<pre class="commandline">
numHosts        10        15        20
iaMean

9         0.089658  0.120800  0.142568
</pre>
<p>
If the user didn't request a confidence interval (error bars), the value of
<tt>errorsdf</tt> will be <tt>None</tt>.

<p>In this case, the default 95% confidence level is used, resulting in the
following output when printing <tt>errorsdf</tt>:

This dataframe has the same structure (column and row headers) as <tt>valuedf</tt>,
with different values. The values represent the half-length of the confidence
interval corresponding to the selected confidence level, so it can be
interpreted as a "+/-" range.

<p>The third dataframe, <tt>metadf</tt>, contains various pieces of metadata about the results.

<p>Here are a few columns from <tt>metadf</tt>:

<pre class="commandline">
                        measurement        module                      title
iaMean
1      $numHosts=10, $iaMean=1, etc.  Aloha.server  channel utilization, last
2      $numHosts=10, $iaMean=2, etc.  Aloha.server  channel utilization, last
3      $numHosts=10, $iaMean=3, etc.  Aloha.server  channel utilization, last
4      $numHosts=10, $iaMean=4, etc.  Aloha.server  channel utilization, last
5      $numHosts=10, $iaMean=5, etc.  Aloha.server  channel utilization, last
7      $numHosts=10, $iaMean=7, etc.  Aloha.server  channel utilization, last
9      $numHosts=10, $iaMean=9, etc.  Aloha.server  channel utilization, last
</pre>
<p>
This dataframe is used to create the legend labels for the series of bars on the
plot. The row headers match those of <tt>valuedf</tt>, while the column headers
represent the names of run and result attributes, as well as iteration
variables. In cases where multiple different values are to be put into the same
cell, only the first value is included, and "etc." is appended.

<p>It should be noted that separating the results into separate dataframes like
this is unnecessary for some other chart types (line charts, histogram charts,
etc.), as those charts do not perform pivot operations on their results. The
corresponding plots accept data formats that can store the metadata in the same
dataframe as the main values to be plotted.

<p>The resulting plot is shown in Figure <a href="chap12.html#fig:ana-barplot">below</a>:

    <a name="fig:ana-barplot"></a>
  </center>

<p>
<pre class="cpp">
utils.postconfigure_plot(props)
</pre>

<p>This line applies the remaining visual properties to the plot.

<p><pre class="cpp">
utils.export_image_if_needed(props)
utils.export_data_if_needed(df, props)
</pre>

<p>These lines perform image and data export. Exporting is accomplished by executing
chart scripts with certain properties set to indicate the desire to export.
<tt>utils.export_image_if_needed()</tt> and
<tt>utils.export_data_if_needed()</tt> take those flag properties, as well as
numerous other properties related to exporting. The latter saves the provided
dataframe as a file.

<p>Based on your personal preferences, you may choose to use a different
environment, language, or tool than the IDE's Analysis tool for analyzing
simulation results. Here are some of the possibilities:

<p><ul>
  <li> Use your favorite Python editor to write the analysis scripts, using
    the packages mentioned in the previous section.
  <li> A <i>Jupyter Notebook</i> can also be used to write up the analysis
    steps, still using Python and the above packages.
  <li> If your simulations produce a large amount of data, you might prefer using
    the SQLite result file format, which allows you to run queries without
    loading all data into memory. Python also has packages to access SQLite files,
    e.g. <tt>sqlite3</tt>.
  <li> If you prefer <i>GNU R</i> over Python/Pandas, it is also a good option.
  <li> You may also choose to use <i>MATLAB</i> or <i>GNU Octave</i> if you
    are more comfortable with them.
  <li> <i>Spreadsheet</i> programs such as Microsoft Excel might be suitable
    if the amount of data allows it. One drawback of using spreadsheets is the
    manual work associated with preparing and reloading data every time
    simulations are rerun.
  <li> A dedicated visual analytics environment such as <i>Tableau</i> might
    be a better choice than spreadsheets.
</ul>

<p>For environments where reading OMNeT++ result files or SQLite result files is
not feasible, the easiest way to proceed is to export simulation
results into CSV with <tt>opp_scavetool</tt>. CSV is a universal format that
nearly all tools understand.
