Installing the Prerequisite Packages
------------------------------------

You can perform the installation using the graphical user interface or from the terminal, whichever you prefer.

Command-Line Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install the required packages, type in the terminal:

.. code::

   $ sudo zypper install make gcc gcc-c++ clang lld bison flex perl \
       python3-devel python3-pip qt5-qtbase-devel libxml2-devel \
       zlib-devel doxygen graphviz xdg-utils libdw-devel libwebkit2gtk-4_1-0
   $ python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
   $ python3 -m pip install -r python/requirements.txt

.. note::

   You may opt to use gcc instead of the clang compiler and/or use the system default linker instead of *lld* by setting
   the ``PREFER_CLANG`` and ``PREFER_LLD`` variables in the *configure.user* file. In this case, you donâ€™t have to
   install the ``clang`` and ``lld`` packages. If you do not need the 3D visualization capabilities, you can disable
   them in the *configure.user* file, too.

To use 3D visualization support in Qtenv (recommended), you should install the OpenSceneGraph-devel (3.2 or later) and
osgEarth-devel (2.7 or later) packages. These packages are not available from the official RedHat repository so you may
need to get them from different sources (e.g. rpmfind.net).

To enable the optional parallel simulation support you will need to install the MPI package:

.. code::

   $ sudo zypper install openmpi-devel

Note that *openmpi* will not be available by default, first you need to log out and log in again, or source your
``.profile`` script:

.. code::

   $ . ~/.profile
